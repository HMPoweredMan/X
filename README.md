X - Soundtrack recorded with orignal studio hardware and modern mastering.

The goal is to recreate a high fidelity Mega Man X soundtrack using synthesizers from the late 80s and early 90s.

Part of the project is to determine what hardware and PCM data was used to originally create the music, acquire the hardware and re-record the tracks and mix and master them using modern techniques.


Hardware acquired so far:

Roland S-330

Roland U-220

Roland R-8M (X2 and later)

Korg EX M1

Korg 01R/W

Proteus/1

Behringer Model D (For Analog MiniMoog sounds)


With a full soundtrack this will enable use with MSU-1 to be played with the original game in addition to a potential digitial and vinyl release.
