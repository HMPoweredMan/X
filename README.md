X - Soundtrack recorded with orignal studio hardware and modern mastering.

The goal is to recreate a high fidelity Mega Man X soundtrack using synthesizers from the late 80s and early 90s **as close as possible to the music from the original video game.**

Part of the project is to determine what hardware and PCM data was used to originally create the music, acquire the hardware and re-record the tracks and mix and master them using modern techniques.


**Hardware acquired so far:**
- Roland S-330
- Roland U-220
- Roland R-8M (X2 and later)
- Korg EX M1
- Korg 01R/W
- Proteus/1
- Behringer Model D (For Analog MiniMoog sounds)

*PCM Cards:*
- SN-U110-02 (Sound Effects)
- MPC-012 (Synth 3)

With a full soundtrack this will enable use with MSU-1 to be played with the original game in addition to a potential digitial and vinyl release.

**Bug reporting**

The intent of the project is accuracy so the issue tracker will be intended for people to report inconsistencies in the high quality tracks with the originals.
This repository will house 16-bit 44100 audio tracks for listening and comparison.

If you want access to 24 bit FLAC versions of the tracks I will provide a link to Patrons on Patreon patreon.com/hmpoweredman

**Things to listen for:**
- Timbre - *Do instruments sound the way they should?*
- Volume - *Is volume accureate relative to other instruments?*
- EQ - *Is bass or treble accurate for specific instruments?*
- Expression - *Are pitch bends and vibrato, portamento accurate and present?*
- Effects - *Do reverb and delay effects sound correct?*
- Stereo Separation - *Are notes playing in the correct pan positions?*

**Note: Some inconsistencies will be unavoidable due to the nature of the project as the SNES S-SMP sound chip will be unused, certain aspects are handled differently by real hardware.

**Roadmap:**
